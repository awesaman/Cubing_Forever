# Cubing Forever

This project is a social media for a social media app for Rubikâ€™s cube solvers. It allows cubers to register, securely login, learn algorithms, practice solving, and compete with one another. The "Compete" tab incorporates a custom-built timer, real-time data transfer, instant messaging, and a customizable statistics display window. The project was made with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, and Node).
